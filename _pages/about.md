I am a pre-doc at the University of Zurich working education, gender, and health economics in the teams of [Ulf Zolizt](https://ulfzoelitz.com/) and [Ana Costa-Ramon](https://sites.google.com/view/anamariacostaramon). I received a dual degree in economics and international studies by the University Carlos III of Madrid in 2022.

I am mainly interested in Public, Development, and Labor economics, with an emphasis on inequality and public policies.
