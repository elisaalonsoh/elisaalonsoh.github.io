# Hello there!
I am a pre-doc at the University of Zurich working on education, gender, and health economics in the teams of [Ulf Zölizt](https://ulfzoelitz.com/) and [Ana Costa-Ramón](https://sites.google.com/view/anamariacostaramon). I received a dual degree in economics and international studies by the University Carlos III of Madrid in 2022. 

I am mainly interested in Public and Labor economics, with an emphasis on applied methods, inequality and public policies.

Here is my [resume](https://https://elisaalonsoh.github.io/files/resume_Elisa_Alonso_Herero_2023)!
