# Elisa Alonso-Herrero
I am a Master Student in Economics at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/). I am mainly interested in Public economics, with an emphasis on taxation, safety net programs, and poverty.

Prior to this, I was a pre-doc at the University of Zurich working on education, gender, and health economics in the teams of [Ulf Zölitz](https://ulfzoelitz.com/) and [Ana Costa-Ramón](https://sites.google.com/view/anamariacostaramon). I received a dual degree in economics and international studies by the University Carlos III of Madrid in 2022, with a year-stay at UC Davis.
